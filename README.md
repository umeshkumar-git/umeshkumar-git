Welcome to **my corner of the internet!** I’m a Computer Science Engineering (CSE) student on a mission to *crack code, debug life*, and build some quirky projects along the way. Here’s what you should know before you dive into this chaos:

## About Me

- 📚 Currently surviving (and sometimes thriving) as a Computer Science Engineering student (B.Tech).
- 🐧 Happily breaking things on Ubuntu—because what's learning without a few system crashes?
- 💻 Can also confirm Windows hasn’t defeated me yet.
- 🚀 Using GitHub as my *trophy shelf* for all things coding, experimenting, and techie adventures.

## Let's Connect

Feel free to ping me if you’ve got an *epic* project idea, need a hand with code, or just want to chat about how annoying semicolons are. I’m always down for collaborations, tech talk, or maybe just grabbing some virtual coffee. ☕️

Happy coding! 🚀✨
